# 1.4 Lab 1
#### Welcome to my first blog post! In this lab, I worked with the digimon.csv dataset, from Kaggle. This dataset includes different Digimon (or "digital monsters), along with information on their stats and skills. The purpose of this lab was to learn information on the different Digimon – such as their average speed or shared attributes – and create teams of three Digimon that meet certain criteria. The conceptual purpose of this lab was to practice reading datasets, using lists and dictionaries, and iterating through data with for loops. Enjoy!

## Task 1: What is the average speed of all Digimon?

The average speed of all Digimon is 120.4. I found this value by creating a method called average_speed. To create this method, I first considered what structure I needed. Some questions I asked myself were: Do I need a list here? That is, would it be faster to just iterate through the speeds and add them to a counter? Or would it be better to store the speeds, then iterate through and add them to a counter?  To decide, I created the following pseudocode: 

```python:
#PSEUDOCODE WITHOUT LISTS
#define method:
    # create a counter
    #create a sum
    #iterate through each digimon:
        # add the digimon's speed to the sum
        #increase counter by one
    #return average, which is sum/counter

#PSEUDOCODE WITH LISTS
#define method:
    # create an empty list of values
    #create a counter
    #create a sum
    # for digimon in data:
       # append data["Spd"] to list
    # for i (index) in the list:
        #add value of index to  sum
        #add one to counter
    #return average, which is sum/counter
```
Clearly, the latter is more inefficient and more lines, as it would necessitate iterating through the dataset two separate times. For that reason, I decided to not create a list/dictionary, and simply use a for loop to tally up all the average speeds (following the first pseudocode). I also included a counter in the for loop to find the number of Digimon, so that I could divide the sum of speeds by the number of Digimon to find the average. 



## Task 2: Write a function that can count the number of Digimon with a specific attribute.
For this function, I struggled a lot to discern which variables I needed to create and which I did not. For example, I spent a lot of time considering how I wanted to store the attributes of each digimon in order to compare it with the parameter attribute. To decide, I worked with Tuhin and Uddipto to come up with a pseudocode. At first, I thought I had to store the digimon's attributes in a variable, so I wrote the following pseudocode:

```python
#define the method, which should take in data, attribute, and attribute values  
    #create a counter
    #create a variable for the digimon attribute
    #create a digimon attribute value variable too
    #for digimon in data:  
        #see the if digimon's attribute is the attribute we want
            #then check if this digimon's attribute value is the attribute value we want
                # add one to the counter
    #return the counter
```

From this pseudocode, I realized that the process of creating a variable to store the information of every single digimon was unneccesary, because we are not actually interested in each digimon – we are only interested in a select few. This is what made me think about eliminting the variable all together, and only tallying up viable digimons (that is, ones that have the desired attribute value). To do so, I eliminated the variables and only used the if statement. To plan this alternative code, I wrote the following pseudocode:

```python
#define a method, which should take in data, attribute, and attribute values:
    #create a counter
    #iterate through digimon with a for loop:
        #check if digimon's attribute has the attribute value of the parameter of the method
            #if so, add one to counter
    #print out the counter

```
I think that this was the trickiest line or logic, as it forced me to recognize that my if statement could directly compare each individual digimon's attributes to our desired attributes without having to store them as a variable in advance. It's also the line of code in this method that I feel most proud of! 




## Task 3: The Digimon on your team are restricted by the total amount of Memory that they need. If your team only has 15 Memory, name a team of up to 3 Digimon that has at least 300 attack (Atk) in total.

A team of three Digimon that has <=15 Memory and at least 300 ATK is 'Kuramon', 'Pabumon', 'Ogremon'.

I tried a number of different approaches for this task. My initial instinct was to try to take a "sliding window" approach. This would entail iterating through the dataset, three digimon at a time, and seeing if that set of three digimon was a viable team. If so, I would print that team out, and if not I would move on to the next group of three. The primary issue I encountered with this tactic was that there was no consecutive group of three digimon that was a viable team. Another issue that I had was figuring out what type of loop would best suit the sliding window. At first I tried a for loop where I shifted the range each loop, but then I tried a while loop that depended on a variable. Here was my pseudocode/starting code for a code with the while loop and sliding windows:

```python
AN EFFORT TO DO 3 WITH SLIDING WINDOWS IDEA:
#define a method that takes data as param
    # b = 3 --> for max value of while loop (to define window range)
    #i = 0 --> for starting value of the while loop
    #let memory counter = 0 
    #let attack counter = 0
    while i < b:
        #add digimon's memory
        #add the digimon's attack
        #add one to counter
        #check if it's a team of three with right credentials
            #print out the team of three   
        #if i == b and (memory_counter >15 or attack_counter <300):
            #add 3 to b to shift the window over
            #set memory counter to 0
            #set attack counter to 0

```
Ultimately, I decided not to use the sliding method because there was no consecutive group of three digimon that worked. I also realized that instead of identifying a group of three digimon, checking to see if the three work as a team, and ditching the entire team if not, it would be much more efficient to "swap out" one of the digimon, rather than scrap the whole team. 

To do so, I collaborated with Tuhin to come up with a nested for loop idea. I decided to use three for loops, each iterating through the same dataset. The outer for loop stores one digimon's attack and memory, the second for loop stores another digimon's attack and memory, and the third for loop stores a third digimon's attack and memory. Then, an if statement checks to see if the sum of the 3 digimon's attack and memory make them a viable team. If so, the method prints out the team! If not, it iterates through the dataset again to find a better team.

One problem I ran into is that at first, my for loop returned a team that included the same digimon twice. To prevent this from happening, I included an if statement, so that after the three loops have created a team of three digimons, it will check to see if those digimons are the same as each other before checking to see if their memory sum and attack sum make them a viable team. One thing I would like to work on is figuring out how to condense this statement. Currently, it looks like this:

```python
if digi_one["Number"] != digi_two["Number"] and digi_one["Number"] != digi_three["Number"] and digi_two["Number"] != digi_three["Number"]:
```
This is quite the line of code to make sense of, and I'd love to figure out a better way to simplify it. I considered using a continue function if they are the same, but that would actually require more lines of code than checking to see if they are not the same as each other. I wonder if starting the for loops in different places would prevent them from overlapping. 




## Concluding thoughts
In conclusion, I really loved this lab! In general, I think that the lab taught me the importance of writing pseudocode. Before I knew this, I would wait so long to write down a code because I was nervous that it wasn't going to work. Writing pseudocode alleviated that worry and let me get my raw thoughts down on the screen so that I could sort through them and make them into a functioning code. It also helped me understand the virtue of using lists in different circumstances – lists can be super useful when it comes through iterating through them because of their indicies. 

A strategy that really helped me with these problems was writing a lot of comments. When I was first writing my code, I would write a comment for every single line to explain to myself what I had done and why I had done it. If I couldn't explain my line of code, it was an indicator that I was confused about what I was doing. It also helped me understand what intuition/ideas led me in the right direction, and which ones led me in the wrong direction. As a newer coder, understanding what big ideas help me approach a new problem is super useful and will make me a stronger coder in the future.
